	<h1>Jennifer Paulino</h1>
	<img src="images/jenpic1.jpg" width="200" height="350">
	<p>Born and raised in Manhattan's Upper West Side, Washington Heights. Hobbies include: surfing the web, watching TV series, searching the web, visiting restaurants, and shopping. In this course I wish to create an app for traditional optical stores where customers can place orders, schedule appointments, receive virtual assistance, etc. I hope to learn the entrepreneurship skills needed to create my own business, gain new insight from my peers as well as the confidence I need to succeed and become a full stack developer. Within five years I see myself completing my Bachelors in Computer Science or IT, working in a tech related field and freelancing as a web/app developer for businesses in my community.</p>
