	<br>
	<p>Born and raised in Manhattan's Upper West Side, Washington Heights. I have been around computers for as long as I can remember. My older cousin always had a computer so I would use hers and navigate all the settings just out of pure boredom and curiosity. At one point, I even owned a computer that was a black screen with a typewriter styled keyboard. In elementary school we had computer class once a week and when I reached the third grade, my teacher recommended I applied to a more advanced middle school that specialized in Math, Science, and Technology; Mott Hall School. There I was able to obtain my first laptop for personal use and most classwork. This lead me to become the techy I am now. Hobbies include: surfing the web, watching TV series, searching the web, visiting restaurants, and shopping. In this course I wish to create an app for traditional optical stores where customers can place orders, schedule appointments, receive virtual assistance, etc. I hope to learn the entrepreneurship skills needed to create my own business, gain new insight from my peers as well as the confidence I need to succeed and become a full stack developer. Within five years I see myself completing my Bachelors in Computer Science or IT, working in a tech related field and freelancing as a web/app developer for businesses in my community.</p>
